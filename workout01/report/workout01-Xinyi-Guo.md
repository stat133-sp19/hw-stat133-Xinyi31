From the summary of data for iguodala, The median for shot\_distance is 18, and the mean of the shot\_distance is 13.69. In addition, iguodala plays in game about 25.63 mins in every game through the whole 2016 season on average.The 2 point & 3 point effecive rate are 0.4942197 and 0.3189655.

Conclusion
==========

Based on the previous data analyze process, and the data for individual player. It is clear that player in different position will behave in different rules. All of the guard baskterball players are active in a the position which is far from the center of the court, so their average shot-distance will be longer. For Graymond Green whose position is PF, he will play the role of defence near the center of the court, so the shot distance of Graymond Green is decrease siginificantly on averge. Four of players play 22mins in every game in 2016 season on average, but iguodala may play more time in every game on avergae. Iguodala may play about 25 minutes in every game.
If we compare five players together and get the result of their shooting situation.

percentage <- arrange(
  summarise(
    group_by(shot_data, name),
    total = length(name),
    made = sum(shot_made_flag == "shot_yes"),
    percentage=sum(shot_made_flag == "shot_yes")/length(name)),
    desc(percentage)
    
)

```

    ## # A tibble: 5 x 4
    ##   name           total  made percentage
    ##   <chr>          <int> <int>      <dbl>
    ## 1 Kevin Durant     915   495      0.541
    ## 2 Andre Iguodala   371   192      0.518

    ## 4 Stephen Curry   1250   584      0.467
    ## 5 Graymond Green   578   245      0.424

From the data table, Stephen Curry has the most opportunity to shot, and the number of the made shot is largest. However, Kevin Durant has the hightest shooting effective rate. Both of them are in a postition, whose main role is to get the points for the team. The data result also prove this idea.

``` r
pt2percentage <- arrange(
  summarise(
    group_by(shot_data, name),
    total = sum(shot_type == "2PT Field Goal"),
    made = sum(shot_made_flag == "shot_yes"& shot_type == "2PT Field Goal"),

    ##   <chr>          <int> <int>      <dbl>
    ## 1 Andre Iguodala   210   134      0.638
    ## 2 Kevin Durant     643   390      0.607
    ## 3 Stephen Curry    563   304      0.540
    ## 4 Klay Thompson    640   329      0.514
    ## 5 Graymond Green   346   171      0.494

From the data, Addre iguodala may have the highest 2 points shooting effective rate, but the sample size of Addre iguodala is smaller than other player such as Kevin Durant orStephen Curry. Addre iguodala has less opportunities to shot 2 points shot, the total shot of 2 points is only 210, about 1/3 of Kevin Durant. Therefore, it may influence the accuracy of the effective rate. However, this may be also caused by the difference of position of different player.

``` r
pt3percentage <- arrange(
  summarise(
    group_by(shot_data, name),
    total = sum(shot_type == "3PT Field Goal"),
    made = sum(shot_made_flag == "shot_yes"& shot_type == "3PT Field Goal"),
    percentage=sum(shot_made_flag == "shot_yes"& shot_type == "3PT Field Goal")/sum(shot_type == "3PT Field Goal")),
    desc(percentage)
    
)

    ## 4 Andre Iguodala   161    58      0.360
    ## 5 Graymond Green   232    74      0.319

based on the 3 points shoot. Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry have a great grade on 3 points shot data. Stephen Curry gets most opportunity to shoot a 3 points shot. Also, the effective rate is pretty high. This fact from the data also support the difference of the postion. Both of Klay Thompson and Stephen Curry are played in guard postion, whose role is to get the points for the team.
